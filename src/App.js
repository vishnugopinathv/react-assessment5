      <h1>Higher Order Functions</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. </li>
        <li> HOCs are not part of the React API,They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.</li>
        <li>a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
      Reason to use Higher-Order component:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to handle</li>
        <li>Get rid of copying the same logic in every component</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Pure Components</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Pure Components in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values</li>
        <li>PureComponent Is Primarily Used for Performance Optimization.</li>
        <li>We can use React.memo for transforming a component into pure component</li>
      </ul>
